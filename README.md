# Church_of_the_Light_3D
A full FreeCAD 3D model of the Church of The Light (1989) designed by Tadao Ando.

This Model was created using the free and open source software FreeCAD. You can download it from https://www.freecadweb.org/

My intention was to provide a complete and accessible 3D model of this iconic architectural work (see License conditions) to the public. For this reason, I did not use other CAD files in this model, but rather I created this model from scratch using as references the original documentation from the following sources:
